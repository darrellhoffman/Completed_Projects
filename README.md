About me: I value engaging with others and effectively communicating ideas, implementing new tools to solve complex problems, being exposed to varied ideas and concepts, improving skills, and making connections. My educational and work experience have required deep analysis, clear and creative written and verbal communication,  leadership, and commitment. I am passionate about the natural world and using data to inform technological solutions to environmental, business, or social challenges.

    "# Background\n",
    "Forests are stressed globally by human activities, whether itâ€™s logging, land-use change for agriculture and industry, or pollution and climate change. These forests store carbon, sustain biodiversity, and provide clean air and water. We will continue to rely on these ecosystems going forward but monitoring the state of forest resources is very challenging, given their extent (a third of the global land area) and their complex and dynamic nature.\n",
    "Remote-sensing techniques, including the use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can increase the volume and speed of spatial information capture in forests. Capturing forest structures with LiDAR produces point clouds from which additional information, like the size and shape of a tree, can be extracted. But before information about a tree can be produced from this data, we need to differentiate between the trees in the point cloud.\n",
    "Preexisting tree segmentation algorithms tend to split the data into voxels, calculate eigenvectors for each point in the voxels, and use this information to find surfaces in the point cloud that can be combined to form stems or branches. While exact techniques vary, a common requirement of these methods is sufficiently dense point clouds. With the insight that in a point cloud flattened to visualize just the x and y dimensions, vertical tree stems would produce dense clusters, We produced an algorithm that could segment trees from single LiDAR scans, by applying a density threshold to detect stems, and clustering points from the bottom up.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Equipment\n",
    "\n",
    "To gather the data we used an ouster OS1-64 portable LiDAR scanner, which captures points in 64 vertical channels covering a 45 degree angle vertically and 360 degrees horizontally. The maximum range is 120m and the precision is close to plusminus 1mm.\n",
    "The Ouster SDK provides code for connecting the sensor to a laptop and recording scans.\n",
    "To scan outdoors we needed an external power source and a tripod, raising the sensor to 1.3m in height.\n",
    "We captured 10 scans in 6 plots at 2 locations, and 7 of these were segmented with the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is loaded as a pandas DataFrame, and an area within the point cloud selected for segmentation, the first step is to remove the terrain or ground points from the data. This loop selects square meter increments, finds the minimum Z-dimension value in the square, and removes the bottom 5cm slice of points above that minimum. The next square meter is selected and the and the process repeated until the ground points have been removed. The results are displayed and the data split into stems (up to 2m in height) and crowns (above 2m in height).\n",
    "The next step is to assign a density value to every point in the stem point cloud. The scipy.spatial KDTree class produces a list of neighbours within a set radius from each point. The length of this list is appended for each point as a density value in the dataframe. This loop asks the user to input a minimum density threshold, under which points will be removed. KMeans is then applied with a user specified number of clusters, segmenting the stems.\n",
    "Some small functions were defined to implement the clustering algorithm and the later tree metric calculations. The, closest_node function, for a given point, finds the nearest point in a separate array or list. This is used later for clustering points in the canopy to the appropriate stems. The furthest_node function finds the greatest distance between points in an array or list and is used to calculate DBH and Crown width for individual trees.\n",
    "The final step is to cluster the crowns to the appropriate stems. This is done with the following loop, which takes a 5cm thick horizontal slice at a 2m height, then using the closest_node function, clusters each point in the slice to the nearest stem. If a point is more than 1m from any stem, it is not clustered. The next slice from 2.05 to 2.10 m height is taken and clustered, and this is repeated until the maximum z-dimension value is reached and all points are clustered or discarded. Any objects below 2m in height are removed automatically and the final results are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Our method succeeded in segmenting the majority of trees in the eight plots tested and outperformed an existing algorithm. The algorithm performed better in stands with fewer non-tree objects and less understory vegetation, and individual trees were segmented better in the sparse data than in the dense data (which is the opposite of 3D Forest). Calculations of individual tree metrics can still be improved, and the algorithm as a whole could be improved by testing different radii for KDTree, using DBSCAN rather an KMeans in some cases, adding a top to bottom clustering pass or adjusting the 1m limit beyond which points are discarded, and differentiating between foliage and wood, possibly using reflectivity and/or infrared values. Finally, with a big enough sample size I would love to apply machine learning techniques to predict attributes such as tree and understory species from the point cloud."
